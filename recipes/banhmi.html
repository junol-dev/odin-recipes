      <p class="recipe-description">
        In Vietnamese cuisine, Bánh mì or banh mi is a short baguette with thin,
        crisp crust and soft, airy texture. It is often split lengthwise and
        filled with savory ingredients like a submarine sandwich and served as a
        meal, called bánh mì thịt. Plain banh mi is also eaten as a staple food.

        <li>French baguette</li>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2-heading">Steps</h2>
      <ol class="list ordered-list">
        <li>
          Place rice vinegar, water, and sugar into a saucepan over medium heat,
          bring to a boil, and stir until the sugar has dissolved, about 1
          minute. Allow the mixture to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over the carrot, radish, and onion in
          a bowl, and allow to stand for at least 30 minutes. Drain off the
          excess vinegar mixture after the vegetables have marinated.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the vegetables are marinating, preheat the oven's broiler, and
          set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Lightly oil a
          slotted broiler pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle the chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper, and broil on
          slotted broiler pan, turning once, until the center of the chicken
          breast is no longer pink and the surface has browned, about 6 minutes
          per side. Remove the broiled chicken, and slice into bite-size pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice the baguette in half the long way, and pull the center of the
          bread out of the baguette halves, leaving a cavity for the filling.
          Place the baguette halves under the broiler to lightly toast, 2 to 3
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          To assemble the bahn mi sandwich, spread each half of the toasted
          baguette with mayonnaise, and fill the cavity of the bottom half of
          the bread with broiled chicken, cucumber slices, pickled carrot,
          onion, and radish, cilantro leaves, and jalapeno pepper. Squeeze a
          wedge of lime over the filling, and top with the other half of the
          baguette.
        </li>
      </ol>
