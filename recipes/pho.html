        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven
          until browned, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until
          blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a
          large stockpot and cover with 4 quarts of water. Bring to a boil and
          reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth
          into a saucepan and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place rice noodles in large bowl filled with room temperature water
          and allow to soak for 1 hour. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and
          after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water for 1
          minute. Bring stock to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and
          green onion. Pour hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until the
          beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve
          with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and
          chile-garlic sauce on the side.
